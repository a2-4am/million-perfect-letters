The main menu music is "Sicilienne" by Gabriel Faur√©. I downloaded it from
https://www.mutopiaproject.org/ftp/FaureG/O78/faure-sicilienne-guitare-doigtee/
faure-sicilienne-guitare-doigtee-a4.pdf and converted it to the Electric Duet
file format. My conversion is released to the public domain.

See "res/Sicilienne score.zip" for the original score as a PDF.
