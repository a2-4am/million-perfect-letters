Due to the inclusion of several GPL-licensed libraries (see below), the program
as a whole is licensed under the GPL 3.0 or later. However, all of my original
code is also licensed under the MIT license, meaning you are free to reuse those
individual files in your own projects (minus the third-party sound libraries)
without requiring GPL licensing. MIT-licensed files are tagged with a comment
";license:MIT" on the first line of each file.

Standard MIT license, which applies to all such tagged files:

The main menu music is "Cembalo", written by Aliam Lenat in 2012 and released to
the public domain. I downloaded it (sheet music as a PDF, plus a sample MIDI
file) from <https://www.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?pdf=49126> and
converted it to the Electric Duet file format. My conversion is also released
to the public domain.
